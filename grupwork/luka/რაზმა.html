       <p class="flex">There are several breeds of cats and they are all  very interesting and people love them very much</p>

       <p class="flex">For example, the Scottish Fold

        The Scottish Fold is a breed of cat with a dominant mutation that causes the ear cartilage to have a fold, resulting in the ears being pointed forward and drooping. This is why the breed is often said to have an owl-like appearance.[1]
        
        Originally called the lop-eared cat, the Scottish Fold was named in 1966. Depending on the breed's registration, long-haired Folds may be referred to as the Highland Fold, Long-haired Scottish Fold, Long-haired Fold, and Couper.[2]</p>
