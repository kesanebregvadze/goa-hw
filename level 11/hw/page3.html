    <p>No matter the season or day of the week, you gotta have a few side dish recipes in your back pocket. From simple
        grains and veggies to decadent, bacon-topped creations, these sides are GUARANTEED to steal the show. So go
        ahead and pick your main dish and get cooking, there's a perfect side in this list of 103 recipes for you.

        When it comes to simple, impressive sides, you don’t have to look much further than your local farmers' market
        or the produce section of your grocery store to create a bright spot on your plate. Particularly when you’re
        serving meat as your main, highlighting colorful veggies is a great way to add some color to your dish. Getting
        in all the health benefits of vegetables is easy when your plate looks like a rainbow! Green veggie dishes, like
        baked zucchini, caprese asparagus, or a spinach salad, are fantastic, but we’re extra fond of the pop of color
        orange and red veggies</p>
