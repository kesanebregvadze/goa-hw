            <p>Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/)[4] is a free and open source[b] Linux distribution, developed by the Debian Project,
                which was established by Ian Murdock in August 1993. Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based
                on the Linux kernel, and is the basis of many other Linux distributions.As of September 2023, Debian is
                the second-oldest Linux distribution still in active development: only Slackware is older. The project
                is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three
                foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free
                Software Guidelines.

                In general, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to some of the principles
                of the GNU Project and Free Software.[5][7] Because of this, the Free Software Foundation sponsored the
                project from November 1994 to November 1995.[8] However, Debian is no longer endorsed by GNU and the FSF
                because of the distribution's long-term practice of hosting non-free software repositories and, since
                2022, its inclusion of non-free firmware in its installation media by default.[5][6] On June 16, 1997,
                the Debian Project founded the nonprofit organization Software in the Public Interest to continue
                financing its development.</p>

            <p class="w">Debian is a free, open-source, Unix-like operating system that uses the Linux kernel and includes
                thousands of packages prebuilt for various purposes. It is one of the oldest and most stable Linux
                distributions, first released in 1993. Debian is used for everything from personal laptops to
                enterprise-grade servers and scientific computing environments.

                Debian is also the upstream source for many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and
                Raspberry Pi OS.
