            <p>Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[15] is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux
                kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus
                Torvalds.[17][18][19] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the
                kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to
                create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL
                license.[20]

                Thousands of Linux distributions exist, many based directly or indirectly on other
                distributions;[21][22] popular Linux distributions[23][24][25] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint,
                Arch Linux, and Ubuntu, while commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux
                Enterprise, and ChromeOS. Linux distributions are frequently used in server platforms.[26][27] Many
                Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and
                recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many
                distributions, causing some controversy.[28][29] Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make
                up a distribution may include a display server (windowing system), a package manager, a bootloader and a
                Unix shell.

                Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. While
                originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than
                any other operating system,[30] and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations,
                mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used
                on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers.[g] When combined with Android, which is Linux-based
                and designed for smartphones, they have the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating
                systems.</p>
