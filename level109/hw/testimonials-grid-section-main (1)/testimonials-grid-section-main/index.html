        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
        can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
        took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
