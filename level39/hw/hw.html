    <center><h2>story</h2></center>
    <p>Missy Moreno is at home with her dad, Marcus, when they receive word to come to the rescue of heroes where Missy has to go with her father and be with other Heroics children.

        Missy meets these other children there:
        
        1.Wheels, who possesses super-strength, but his muscles are too heavy for his skeletal system to support.
        <br>
       2. Noodles, who can stretch his body.
       <br>
        3.Ojo, who is mute and communicates through art. 
        <br>
       4. A-Capella, who can telekinetically manipulate objects by singing.
       <br>
        5.Slo-Mo, who is always in slow motion, due to being in a time warp.
        <br>
        6.Face Maker, who can morph his face into anyone.
        <br>
        7.Rewind and Fast Forward, twins who can alter time. 
        <br>
        8.Wild Card, who has immense powers but no control over it.
        <br>
        9.Guppy, who has "shark strength" and can shape water into anything she can imagine.
        <br>
        The kids watch the battle between the aliens and Heroics on television, ending with the Heroics' capture. Missy realizes that Ojo's drawings tell the future. When a drawing shows aliens breaking into the vault, the kids hatch a plan to escape.
        
        Face Maker tricks the guards into coming into the vault where Guppy subdues them, but not before one of the guards triggers an emergency lockdown. Rewind sends them back in time, Wheels stops the guard from pushing the button, and Noodles steals their security badges. Mrs. Graneda spots Missy in the hallway and seals the doors, but A-Capella makes a staircase to the roof, allowing them to escape. Noodles secure a vehicle, and the kids escape.
        
        They land at the home of Missy's grandmother, Anita Moreno, who is the Heroics' trainer and helps the kids master their powers and work as a team. The aliens arrive and Grandma sends the kids through a tunnel that leads to an empty field before she is captured. The kids spot an empty alien craft and use it to reach the Mother ship. Locating a room with a purple pyramid, they see the president and Ms. Graneda speaking. They are alien spies, sent to prepare Earth for a "takeover". The kids are placed in a cell. Guppy makes a replica of the key from the children's tears and opens the door. A fight between the kids and the aliens ensues, and Wild Card is caught and taken for questioning while the others seek the pyramid.
        
        Wheels hacks into the motherboard, but Ojo reveals that she can speak and is the Supreme Commander of the aliens. Missy communicates with Wild Card in the control room; Face Maker has switched places with him. Graneda goes after Wild Card, but not before the protective shield around the motherboard is deactivated. With the kids holding off the aliens, Wheels and Noodles remove the motherboard and swap it with a new one deactivating the alien's rocket and foiling the takeover. To the kids' surprise, their parents emerge from the rocket. Ojo reveals that she and Ms. Graneda faked the "takeover" to train the kids to be the new Heroics. The kids reunite with their parents and are soon ready to save the world.</p>
