        <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
            mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
            shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a
            pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for
            companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey
            species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its
            night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
            crepuscular predator.</p>
